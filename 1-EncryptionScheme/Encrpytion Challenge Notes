Make sure assumptions (especially threat model) are strictly defined
	- assume hacker has no access to memory but is able to listen to transmissions over wire, 
	  and has access to a lot of computing resources
	- also assume they have the ability to change bits being sent
	- focus on cryptographic primitives (confidentiality and integrity)
	- address replay attacks (033 notes -> IDs) and other possible attacks
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_signature#:~:text=In%20cryptography%2C%20a%20Lamport%20signature,cryptographic%20hash%20function%20is%20used.
	- https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/607.pdf
	- mention side channel attacks (heat, power draw, etc.)
	- mention possibility of a replay attack possibly add a date and time
	
	  
General Structure:
	- 3 files (two people talking to each other) -> have to have some way to agree on algs being used beforehand
	

Design Choices:
	Who is system being designed for?
	- General pupose yet robust encrpytion suite designed for wide spread use
	- possibly for computers with above average computer power (check the compute needed for chosen algorithms)
	- CIA triad + NIST standards
	- mention drawbacks of quantum safe signatures
	
	Choices made:
		- allowed for modularity so people can choose based on need
		- makes it better for general pupose while maintaining robustenss by limiting option
		- for some paramters no choice given (encrypt then mac)
